# [genui](https://pub.dev/packages/genui) Changelog

## 0.10.7

- **Fix**: Validation `checks` on `CheckBox`, `Slider` and `ChoicePicker` now fail when their condition is false, and show the check's `message` instead of a generic "Invalid value".
- **Fix**: `and`/`or` now evaluate bindings and function calls inside `values`, so a failing nested check fails the rule.
- **Behavior change**: Conditions use truthiness instead of a null check. `0`, `''`, `[]`, `{}` and unknown functions evaluate to `false`, and malformed condition expressions log a warning.
- **Behavior change**: `resolve()` and `resolveContext()` recursively resolve dynamic values inside lists.

## 0.10.6

- Added `AsynchronousClientFunction` base class for single-shot asynchronous
  client functions returning a `Future` (via `executeAsync`), complementing
  `SynchronousClientFunction` (`executeSync`).

## 0.10.5

- **Fix**: Resolve validation checks and preserve error messages across basic catalog components.
  - Recursively evaluate `List` arguments in `DataContext._evaluateStream` so logical functions (`and`, `or`) receive resolved values.
  - Remove invalid `'functionCall'` envelope from `checksToExpression` and support tolerant unwrapping in `_evaluateStream`.
  - Align truthiness evaluation in `isTruthy` across primitives, data model objects, and structured `ValidationResult` objects, while warning on malformed expressions or missing functions.
  - Migrate `CheckBox`, `Slider`, and `ChoicePicker` to `ValidationHelper.validateStream` to evaluate rules individually and display authored error messages.
- Fixed `Slider` deriving `divisions` from range, allowing continuous sliding
  by default (`divisions: null`), preventing assertion crashes on sub-unit
  ranges, fixing thumb value text formatting and literal value fallback, and
  handling inverted ranges (`max < min`).

## 0.10.4

- **Docs**: Added an announcement to the README that `genui` is being
  redesigned as modular packages: [`a2ui_core`](https://pub.dev/packages/a2ui_core),
  [`a2ui_agent`](https://pub.dev/packages/a2ui_agent), and
  [`a2ui_flutter`](https://pub.dev/packages/a2ui_flutter).
- **Fix**: `Image` now takes the catalog's `description` property and announces it. The property is what the basic
  catalog defines for accessibility text, and `web_core` declares it, but genui's schema did not have it, so the text
  an agent sent was accepted and dropped. An image has nothing inside it to infer a name from, so the result was an
  unnamed node that assistive technology did not even report as an image. The value is a `DynamicString`, so a path
  or a function call resolves like any other property.
- **Fix**: `CheckBox` shows a literal `value` again. It bound the checkbox to a
  data model path and never read the literal the model sent, so a component
  that said the setting was on rendered unchecked, announced itself unchecked,
  and logged nothing. `Slider` and `TextField` already fall back to their
  literal until the path holds something; this does the same.

## 0.10.3

- Updated `basicCatalogId` to point to the canonical URL: `https://a2ui.org/specification/v0_9/catalogs/basic/catalog.json`.
- Introduced `catalogIdAliases` in `Catalog` model to support alternate URLs (like the legacy/non-canonical one) for graceful backwards compatibility.
- Augmented `SurfaceController` so that the protocol processor successfully processes both canonical and secondary aliases transparently.
- Fixed `PluralizeFunction` to use `Intl.pluralLogic` instead of `Intl.plural` to
  avoid message extraction errors when arguments are dynamic runtime
  expressions.

## 0.10.2

- Fixed `A2uiTransportAdapter.incomingText` trimming every streamed chunk, which
  made words run together when chunks were concatenated.

- Added examples of how to use TextField.

- Fixed `TextField` variants: `longText` now grows to fit multiple lines,
  `number` now rejects non-numeric input, and the `obscured`
  example now sets `variant` so that it is actually obscured.

- `TextField.validationRegexp` is now enforced: the value has to match the
  pattern in full, an empty field is exempt, and a value that does not match
  shows an error and blocks `onSubmittedAction`. It was previously accepted and
  ignored.

## 0.10.1

- Depend on `a2ui_core` 0.1.0, its first non-pre-release version.

## 0.10.0

- **BREAKING**: Changed `SurfaceDefinition.validate` to be asynchronous to support resolving `$ref` schemas via `SchemaRegistry`.
- **Refactor**: genui now runs on `package:a2ui_core`. See
  [the migration guide](../../docs/usage/migration/migration_0.9.1_to_0.10.0.md).
- **BREAKING**: A2UI message types are now `package:a2ui_core` types. The GenUI
  message classes (`A2uiMessage`, `CreateSurface`, `UpdateComponents`,
  `UpdateDataModel`, `DeleteSurface`) are removed; `SurfaceController.handleMessage`
  and `Transport.incomingMessages` take `a2ui_core` messages, and
  `UpdateComponentsMessage` carries raw component JSON maps rather than `Component`
  objects. Depend on `a2ui_core` directly.
- **BREAKING**: `SurfaceController.store` and `DataModelStore` are removed. Read a
  surface's data model via `SurfaceController.contextFor(id).dataModel`.
- **BREAKING**: `SurfaceRegistry.updateSurface(...)` is removed; drive surfaces
  through `SurfaceController.handleMessage`.
- **BREAKING**: Changed `PromptBuilder.chat` and `PromptBuilder.custom` from synchronous factory constructors to asynchronous static methods (`createChat` and `createCustom`) to support asynchronous asset loading.
- **BREAKING**: Changed `_loadSchemas` return type to a named record structure.
- **BREAKING**: Restricted public API surface of low-level `primitives` exports. Only `CancellationException`, `CancellationSignal`, `JsonMap`, `basicCatalogId`, `configureLogging`, `genUiLogger`, and `generateId` are now exported from `package:genui/genui.dart`.
- **Behavior**: `DataModel` writes are stricter; some writes that previously did
  nothing now throw, and sparse list writes fill skipped entries with `null`.
- **Behavior**: A duplicate `createSurface` for an already-active surface id is now
  an error.
- The catalog-widget authoring API is unchanged; `SurfaceDefinition` and
  `Component` remain genui types.
- **Refactor**: Extracted exception mapping logic to a private helper `_errorToMap` in `SurfaceController`.
- **Refactor**: Centralized and shared common schema registry initialization helper.
- **Refactor**: Extracted mock binary messenger asset setup to a shared helper for test reuse.
- **Fix**: Sanitized raw error messages exposed from `ArgumentError` in `Button` press handlers.
- **Docs** Removed `google_generative_ai` from the README.md.

- **Fix**: Improved error handling and reporting through the `ContentGenerator.errorStream` and `ContentGeneratorError` class.

## 0.2.0

- **BREAKING**: Replaced `ElevatedButton` with a more generic `Button` component.
- **BREAKING**: Removed `CheckboxGroup` and `RadioGroup` from the basic catalog. The `MultipleChoice` or `CheckBox` widgets can be used as replacements.

- **Feature**: Added many new components to the basic catalog: `AudioPlayer` (placeholder), `Button`, `Card`, `CheckBox`, `DateTimeInput`, `Divider`, `Heading`, `List`, `Modal`, `MultipleChoice`, `Row`, `Slider`, `Tabs`, and `Video` (placeholder).
- **Fix**: Corrected the action key from `actionName` to `name` in `Trailhead` and `TravelCarousel`.
- **Fix**: Corrected the image property from `location` to `url` in `TravelCarousel`.
